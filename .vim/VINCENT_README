Goal: to combine the syntax checker (VIM) and the LANGUAGE SYNTAX CHECKER all in one. 
Also working independent with the /usr/share/lib from neither centos nor debian

#Copy the library of vim to the home/.vim foler
#Merged the syntastic files into the .vim : autoload, plugin , etc...
#keep the backup folder exist for everytime merging the file into .vim ..so ignore such like autoload-syntastic
# moving vimrc-Vincent to .vimrc to $HOME and edit .bashrc .vimrc as approriately
